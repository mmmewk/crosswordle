## Puzzle catalog

Puzzles are all hand written using [crosshare](https://crosshare.org)

If you would like to submit a puzzle email me at [submissions.crosswordle@gmail.com](mailto:submissions.crosswordle@gmail.com).
Puzzles should contain only words in the english dictionary, and be ~90% commonly known words.
Try to minimize the number of 2 letter words and letters only connected to a single word, as both of those add a larger element of luck into the puzzle.
Include your name and I will give you credit as the author of the puzzle!
